# To-Do List

This project is a to-do list application built using the JavaScript Vue framework. I worked on this project independently to solidify my knowledge of Vue and recreate the fundamental principles of a CRUD application in a stylish design. The project saves data to local storage and does not interact with a server, which means that any data inputted is stored on the user's device and completely confidential. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my proficiency with Vue and the principles of CRUD, and it has already been adopted by several users for daily use.
